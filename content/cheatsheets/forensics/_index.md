Digital Forensics is a specialized branch of forensic science focused on the identification, collection, preservation, examination, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence derived from computers, mobile devices, networks, and other digital storage media. This process must be conducted using forensically sound methods to ensure the integrity of the evidence and its admissibility in legal proceedings or internal investigations.
