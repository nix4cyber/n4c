Network attacks are a category of attacks that target wireless networks. These attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to a network, intercept data, or disrupt network services. Some common network attacks include:

- Wifi Security Attacks : WEP cracking, WPA/WPA2 handshake capture, WPA3 downgrade attacks, etc.
- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks : Deauth attacks, jamming, CTS flooding, etc.
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks : Evil twin attacks (Rogue AP), SSL Stripping, Wifi phishing, etc.
- Eavesdropping Attacks : Packet sniffing, traffic analysis, decoding, etc.
- Other Exploits : Default credentials, firmware vulnerabilities (RCE/ACE), etc.
