## Visualisation

Use [OSINTracker](https://app.osintracker.com/) to visualise your findings.
It allows you to create a graph of your findings, which can help you see connections and relationships between different pieces of information.

## Forgotten passwords

To find email addresses and phone numbers associated with an account, you can click on "Forgot password?" on the login page of a website. Be careful, though, this creates notifications and can be detected by the target, and often gives your information away.

## Archive Search

- **Wayback Machine** (<https://web.archive.org>) stores over 618 billion web captures
- **Archive.today** (<https://archive.ph>) creates on-demand snapshots, including for JS-heavy sites, with both a functional page and screenshot version
