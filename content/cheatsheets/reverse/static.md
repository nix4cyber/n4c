## Ghidra

Ghidra is a GUI tool for reverse engineering software. It provides a comprehensive set of features for analyzing compiled code, including disassembly, decompilation, and debugging.
As Ghidra is a complete tool that brings together many features, we recommend doing CTF challenges to get familiar with it. To do so you can use the following [Cheat Sheet](https://refined-github-html-preview.kidonng.workers.dev/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/raw/refs/heads/master/GhidraDocs/CheatSheet.html).

```bash
nix-shell -p ghidra --run ghidra
```
