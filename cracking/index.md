# 🔐 Cracking

Cracking is the process of recovering passwords, keys, or other protected data from hashed, encrypted, or obfuscated forms. This often involves methods like brute force, dictionary attacks, or cryptographic analysis — typically used in security research, CTFs, or penetration testing environments.

## 🐚 Shell

The shell contains all the tools & files needed to perform the attack category.

**Start the shell with the following command:**

```bash
nix develop --refresh github:nix4cyber/n4c#cracking
```
