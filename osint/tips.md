## Visualisation

Use [OSINTracker](https://app.osintracker.com/) to visualise your findings.
It allows you to create a graph of your findings, which can help you see connections and relationships between different pieces of information.

To find email addresses and phone numbers associated with an account, you can click on "Forgot password?" on the login page of a website. Be careful, though, this creates notifications and can be detected by the target.

## Archive Search

- **Wayback Machine** (<https://web.archive.org>) stores over 618 billion web captures
- **Archive.today** (<https://archive.ph>) creates on-demand snapshots, including for JS-heavy sites, with both a functional page and screenshot version
